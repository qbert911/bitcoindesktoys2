### Task:
```
I am planning to install a Starlink system at camp.
But it is not clear what antenna location would work best.
As I try different locations I would like to have a way to monitor the connection over time.
Starlink says there must be line-of-sight to the satellites or the connection will drop.  
But there is no guidance as to the aperture of the line-of-sight required.
Will a single leaf break the connection, or is an entire tree required?
The satellites move, thus I need to monitor the connection over time.
Here is a programming challenge for you.
```


### Specifications:
```
The program should run on a Windows 10 PC.
Write a program to do the following: Every minute check the Starlink connection.
Write to a text file the time and connection success.
Time should be in minutes since the program was started.
Success can be a 1 or 0.
Connection between Starlink and the computer is via Bluetooth.
Feel free to add any embellishments after that.
Maybe record an actual time stamp, or display a realtime graph of connection vs. time, or just a scrolling text of time and success.
It would be nice to have a connection speed test with each connection, but that may be too difficult to program.
